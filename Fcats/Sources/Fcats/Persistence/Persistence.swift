 This class represents the persistence layer.
 It holds a database connection and provides access to the database's collections.
 
 The actual persistence operations are provided by repositories.
 These repositories aren't implemented as types because they don't require any state.
 They consist entirely of functions, which is why they're implemented as extensions on this class.
