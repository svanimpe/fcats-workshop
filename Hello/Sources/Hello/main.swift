 As you can see, a route handler has three parameters:
 - The current `request`, from which you can read data.
 - The current `response`, which you can configure.
 - The `next` handler or middleware in the chain.
 Unless an error was thrown or you called `end()` on the response,
 your handler should end with `next()`.
